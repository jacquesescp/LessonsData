    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we explore quantitative equity analysis through various factor models and benchmarks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: This fundamental model establishes the relationship between risk and expected return for an investment. We'll calculate the CAPM beta, a measure of an asset's sensitivity to market movements, and assess its expected return. (Please note: if students do not have previous knowledge of asset pricing or CAPM, please feel free to read this part quickly as for gaining background information. **In this module, particularly for preparing the final exam, students should focus more on Python real-world applications and coding implementations, rather than remembering detailed and sophisticated finance theories. The introduction of theories as mentioned in this notebook should be enough, no need to expand them.**)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fama-French Model**: Building upon CAPM, the Fama-French Model incorporates additional factors beside market risk to explain return variations. We'll explore these factors and their influence on asset performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Factor Benchmarks**: We'll construct factor benchmarks to compare an asset's performance against a basket of securities representing specific risk factors. This allows us to isolate an investment's performance relative to these factors."

    "With Fama-French model, we have that $\\alpha$ has fallen from $0.63\\%$ to about $0.54\\%$ per month. The loading on the market has moved up from about $0.56$ to $0.69$, which means that adding these new explanatory factors did, effectively, change things. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the loadings on Value being positive (i.e., the **positive beta coefficient of HML**) as saying that **Berkshire Hathaway has a significant Value tilt** - which should not be a shock to anyone that follows Buffet. Additionally, the negative tilt on Size (i.e., **negative beta coefficient of SMB**) suggests that **Berkshire Hathaway tends to invest in large companies rather than small companies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, **Berkshire Hathaway appears to be a Large Value investor**. Of course, we may already know this if we were following the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new way to interpret each dollar invested in Berkshire Hathaway is: \n",
    "- long **$69$ cents in the market and short $31$ cents in T-Bills**; \n",
    "- long **$39$ cents in Value stocks and short $61$ cents in Growth stocks**; \n",
    "- short **$49$ cents in SmallCap stocks and long $51$ cents in LargeCap stocks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if we were to do all of this, we would still end up underperforming Berkshire Hathaway by about $0.54\\%$ (**54 basis points**) per month."

    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "We began with the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**, a foundational model that relates expected return to **beta**, a measure of systematic risk. We then examined the **Fama-French Model**, a three-factor extension of CAPM that incorporates size and value factors to explain return variations. Factor benchmarks were introduced as a way to compare portfolio performance against relevant risk factors. \n"
